### Webpage Theme Switcher
[**thm.js**](//github.com/techie-joe/base/blob/main/legacy/cjs/thm.js) :
The original theme switcher from my old project. Adds both light and dark theme to your web page. You can easily switch between the two by using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Alt + T` or execute `base.theme.change()` with a button.
